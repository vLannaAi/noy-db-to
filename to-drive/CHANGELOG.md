# @noy-db/to-drive

## 0.6.0-pre.7

### The peer-floor guard now runs on source changes

- **No functional change to this package.** Its `dist` is byte-identical to `0.6.0-pre.6`; this release carries a CI fix and exists to keep the registry in step with `main`.
- **`peer-floor.yml` was triggered on manifest edits only**, so a source change never ran it ([#104](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/104)). A declared peer range becomes false in two ways, and the guard could see one: a manifest edit changes the range directly, while a source edit changes what the code *needs* — adopting a symbol the floor does not have. Both `pull_request` and `push` filters now include `to-*/src/**`.

  Measured across published tarballs, three symbols exist at the current dev pin and at **neither** declared floor — `RefNotDeclaredError`, `KeyringTamperedError` and `RecordRef`. A single `src/` import of any of them would falsify both ranges, compile cleanly against the dev pin, and pass every other gate.

- Peer ranges are unchanged: `^0.6.0-pre.0`, and `^0.6.0-pre.11` for `to-drive`/`to-icloud`. Verified true at both floors.

## 0.6.0-pre.6

### Hub dev pin moved to `0.6.0-pre.23`

- **The peer range is unchanged**, and that is the important part: `^0.6.0-pre.0` (`^0.6.0-pre.11` for `to-drive`/`to-icloud`). A consumer's floor is the peer range, never this package's dev pin.
- **Existing installs:** adding or upgrading `@noy-db/to-*` alone does **not** move your hub. If you are already on an earlier `0.6.0-pre`, you keep it, and you meet no format change.
- **Fresh installs differ.** npm auto-installs peers at the newest satisfying version, and `^0.6.0-pre.0` admits `0.6.0-pre.23` — so installing from nothing gets you the current hub. With no existing data that is a non-event.

  ```
  FRESH     npm i @noy-db/to-postgres@next                    -> hub 0.6.0-pre.23
  EXISTING  npm i @noy-db/hub@0.6.0-pre.16 ; then the store   -> hub 0.6.0-pre.16
  ```

- **No functional change to this package.** Its `dist` is byte-identical to `0.6.0-pre.5`; only the development pin and the repo's own docs moved.
- Every store was verified to compile against the oldest hub its declared range admits, at both distinct floors.

### The ciphertext this store holds is unaffected by the 0.6 format changes

Two format changes landed upstream between `0.6.0-pre.18` and `0.6.0-pre.23`, and they have opposite shapes. Neither is a defect in this package, and neither touches the bytes a store holds — a store never decrypts.

- `pre.18` bound record identity into the AEAD. Records written before it cannot be opened by `pre.18` or later.
- `pre.21` authenticated the keyring roster. This fails at **unlock**, not at a record read, and travels with the vault rather than the payload.

The AEAD scheme is byte-identical across `pre.18 … pre.23`, so records remain cross-readable within that range. See `README.md` — *What a passing test suite here does and does not prove*.

## 0.6.0-pre.5

### The release path refuses to route a pre-release to `@latest`

- **No functional change to this package.** Its `dist` is byte-identical to `0.6.0-pre.4`; this release carries a repo-level release-integrity guard.
- **Added the pre-release routing guard** ([#97](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/97)). The npm dist-tag was routed entirely by the "Set as a pre-release" checkbox on the GitHub Release form, with nothing refusing a mismatch — so a forgotten tick would publish a pre-release to `@latest`, which is not self-healing (`npm dist-tag` is an account-changing write needing an interactive 2FA OTP, so CI can never repair it). `release.yml` now fails the release when a semver pre-release version is published from a Release not marked as a pre-release. Only that direction is blocked — a stable version on `@next` is recoverable and stays allowed.

  This repo needed it most and had it last: its `@latest` is already broken (all 17 `to-*@0.5.0` versions are deprecated), and a pre-release landing there would add a second, independent defect to the same tag. noy-db-ui, noy-db and klum-db adopted the guard earlier.

Peer range is unchanged: `^0.6.0-pre.0` (`^0.6.0-pre.11` for `to-drive`/`to-icloud`).

## 0.6.0-pre.4

### Release-integrity work — no change to published code

- **No functional change to this package.** Its `dist` is byte-identical to `0.6.0-pre.3`; this release carries repo-level release-integrity work and exists to bring the registry back in step with `main`.
- **The peer-floor guard now gates releases** ([#94](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/94)). It was triggered only on `pull_request`/`push`, which a `release` event never matches — so a release could publish a peer range the guard would have rejected. It is now a `workflow_call` from `release.yml`, checked out at the release tag, and `publish` depends on it.
- **Three defects fixed in the guard's range analysis** ([#95](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/95)). `semver.minVersion` throws on a malformed range, returns null on an unsatisfiable one, and floors an unbounded range (`*`, `x`, blank) at `0.0.0` — a version no `@noy-db` package has published. Only the null case was handled. All three now fail fast and name the package.
- **The docs-bridge store table is derived, not counted** ([#93](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/94)). A missing entry previously made the bridge throw while the release still reported success; the expected set is now read from the `to-*` directories, and a bridge failure writes a loud block to the run summary.

Peer range is unchanged: `^0.6.0-pre.0` (`^0.6.0-pre.11` for `to-drive`/`to-icloud`, which need a generic `StoreLocator.register()`).

## 0.6.0-pre.3

### Peer range narrowed to the versions that actually work ([#89](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/89), [#90](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/90))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → **`^0.6.0-pre.11`**, replacing `^0.4.0-pre.11 || ^0.5.0 || ^0.6.0-pre.0`. Two separate falsehoods were retired: `StoreDescriptor` / `StoreFactory` / `StoreLocator` only exist from `0.6.0-pre`, and — specific to the pod stores — registering a `NoydbPodStore` factory without a cast needs `StoreLocator.register()` to be **generic over both store shapes**, which landed in `0.6.0-pre.11`. `register()` existed before that; it simply could not accept the argument. Floor verified by compiling this package against it, not by probing symbol names.

  The family rule is *widen by appending*, which assumes compatibility only grows. It does not: adopting a symbol that exists only from a given upstream version silently retracts the older branches, and no gate notices. **Narrowing is the honest correction.**

### Migrated off the removed hub aliases ([#87](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/87))

- `BundleVersionConflictError` → `PodVersionConflictError` in tests, and `wrapBundleStore()` → `wrapPodStore()` in the source doc comments — **which ship in the published `.d.ts`**, so this was not a tests-only migration. Downstream half of noy-db#1052.

### Hub 0.6.0-pre.16 adopted ([#87](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/88))

- Dev pins → `0.6.0-pre.16` for `@noy-db/hub` and `@noy-db/test-adapter-conformance`, moved as a **unit** — a hub-only bump leaves siblings behind and invites the tree to resolve two copies of the same lockstep line.

## 0.6.0-pre.2

### Hub 0.6.0-pre.11 adopted ([#83](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/83))

- Dev pins → `0.6.0-pre.11` for `@noy-db/hub` and `@noy-db/test-adapter-conformance`. `peerDependencies` are **unchanged**: `^0.6.0-pre.0` already admits later pre-releases on the same `major.minor.patch`, so a same-line hub release does not force a rebuild on consumers. Eight hub releases landed since `pre.3` (pre.4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 — pre.6 was never published) and **the store contract did not move**: `kernel/types` and `kernel/errors` are byte-identical between the two, and the hub's exports map neither gained nor lost a subpath. The `/to` seam gained `AnyNoydbStore`, `isPodStore()`, a generic `StoreFactory<S>` and `resolveAny()` — all additive. Full conformance re-validated.

### Registers without a cast ([#84](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/84))

- `StoreLocator.register()` is generic over both store shapes since hub `0.6.0-pre.11` (noy-db#988), so this pod store no longer registers through `as unknown as StoreFactory`. The `NoydbPodStore` return is now inferred rather than asserted away — a double cast suppressed checking in both directions, so a future change to the factory's return type is now caught instead of swallowed. No runtime change.

## 0.6.0-pre.1

### Descriptors may only set declared keys ([#69](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/69))

- `to-drive` descriptors can no longer set anything the store's `DescriptorOptions` / `Address` types declare no field for. The factory destructures named fields instead of spreading the descriptor's unchecked `options` (and, where applicable, `address`) bag into the store options. Where the winning key was applied *conditionally*, a matching key in that bag previously survived and won — here: `handles` — a binding-owned slot applied only when `binding.handles` was absent, i.e. an arbitrary handle registry redirecting every vault to caller-chosen Drive file ids — and `parentId`. New `#69` tests assert an undeclared key cannot reach the store.

### Hub 0.6.0-pre.3 adopted ([#74](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/74))

- Dev pins → `0.6.0-pre.3` for `@noy-db/hub` and `@noy-db/test-adapter-conformance`. `peerDependencies` are **unchanged**: the existing `^0.6.0-pre.0` already admits later pre-releases on the same `major.minor.patch`, which is the ranged peer doing its job — a same-line hub release must not force a rebuild on consumers. The `/to` store contract is unchanged (hub `pre.2` was comment-only; `pre.3` covers pod-write strictness, a barrel re-export, and a codemod asset). Full conformance re-validated.

## 0.5.0

### Store-locator descriptor adopted ([#58](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/58))

- New `driveStoreDescriptor()` / `driveStoreFactory` / `registerDriveStore()` (plus the `DriveAddress`, `DriveDescriptorOptions`, `DriveBinding` types) — a credentialless, JSON-serializable `StoreDescriptor` (`kind: 'drive'`, `class: 'cloud'`) reconstructs the store via `createStoreLocator()`. `address` is `{ parentId? }`, the Drive parent folder id; omitted leaves the store's existing `appDataFolder` default intact. `options` is `{ suffix? }`, the bundle filename suffix (default `'.noydb'`). `opts.binding.client` is required because this store does not construct its own connection — mapped onto the store's `drive` option; resolving without it throws a clear error naming the missing slot. `binding.handles` carries the per-device `HandleStore`; omitted leaves the store's in-memory default. `toDrive()` returns a `NoydbPodStore`, so — like `to-icloud` — `driveStoreFactory`'s return type is deliberately unnarrowed and `registerDriveStore()` registers it via a documented `as unknown as StoreFactory` cast. Verified by a descriptor→resolve→full-conformance round-trip (via `wrapPodStore()`) plus an address-forwarding test against the injected mock Drive client.

## 0.4.0

### Hub 0.6.0-pre.1 adopted, conformance suite de-vendored ([#19](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/19))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` widened with `|| ^0.6.0-pre.0`; dev pin → `0.6.0-pre.1`. The `/to` store contract is unchanged.
- The adapter-conformance suite is no longer vendored in this repo — every store now runs the published `@noy-db/test-adapter-conformance`, so the store contract has one definition instead of two that could drift. Full conformance re-validated.


## 0.3.1

### Hub 0.5.0 stable adopted ([#52](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/52))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → `^0.4.0-pre.11 || ^0.5.0`, dev pin → `0.5.0`. Full conformance re-validated against the published hub 0.5.0 stable (`@latest`); the `/to` store contract is unchanged. Hub 0.5.0 exports `isConflictError` from its root (noy-db#935), making the store-error identity contract (`name === 'ConflictError'`) load-bearing engine-side — this store already satisfies it via the shared error class.

### Hub peer floor raised to 0.4.0-pre.11 ([#30](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/30))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → `^0.4.0-pre.11` (was `^0.3.0 || ^0.4.0`). This store conforms through the hub's `wrapPodStore()`, which lost concurrent writes and leaked internals in `loadAll()` until hub `0.4.0-pre.11` (noy-db#908) — verified the 0.3.x wrapper carries both defects, so the `^0.3.0` arm is dropped too. Machine-checkable floor instead of a README caveat; the other 14 stores keep `^0.3.0 || ^0.4.0`.

## 0.3.0

### Hub 0.4.0 stable adopted ([#38](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/38))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → `^0.3.0 || ^0.4.0`, dev pin → `0.4.0`. Full conformance re-validated against the published hub 0.4.0 stable (`@latest`), whose `db.transaction(fn)` now genuinely delegates to `store.tx()` on `txAtomic` stores (noy-db#906).

## 0.3.0-pre.3

### Test-only: wired into the shared adapter-conformance suite ([#26](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/26))

- No runtime changes — lockstep version bump. The store now runs the vendored `@noy-db/test-adapter-conformance` contract in CI. The store is a `NoydbPodStore`, so it conforms through the hub's `wrapPodStore()` — the wrapper defects this surfaced (internal-collection leak in `loadAll`, concurrent-`put()` last-writer-wins) were noy-db#908, fixed in `@noy-db/hub 0.4.0-pre.11`, which is now the dev-test pin (peer range unchanged).

## 0.3.0-pre.1

### BREAKING: factory renamed to `toDrive()` ([#18](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/pull/18))

- `drive()` → `toDrive()` — every extended store now exports a `to<Backend>()`-named factory matching the package-prefix grammar. Import sites change; options and behavior are identical.

### Hub 0.4.0 pre line adopted ([#20](https://github.com/vLannaAi/noy-db-to/issues/20))

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → `^0.3.0 || ^0.4.0-pre.10`, dev pin → `0.4.0-pre.10`. The `@noy-db/hub/to` store contract is byte-identical between hub `0.3.0` and `0.4.0-pre.10` (seam types and runtime verified), so the range spans both lines; the full suite runs against `0.4.0-pre.10`.

## 0.2.0

### Hub floor normalized to the first stable

- `peerDependencies["@noy-db/hub"]` → `^0.3.0`, dev pin → `0.3.0` (noy-db's first stable on `@latest`). No adapter code changes: the 0.3.0 store-contract deltas (`_del` envelope field, `/adapter`→`/to` retirement, `StoreCredentials` seam) were adopted during the 0.3.0-pre line; this release re-validates the full conformance suite against the published stable.

## 0.2.0-pre.5

Version-only lockstep bump; no source changes since pre.4.

Version-only lockstep bump; no source changes since pre.3.

## 0.2.0-pre.3

- # v0.1.0-pre.6 — Per-principal user envelope + niwat client-API unblockers

  ## Per-principal user envelope (`vault.user.*`)

  Every keyring in a vault now gets its own `_users/<keyringId>` envelope, encrypted under a vault-shared `_users` DEK. Hub owns the plumbing (storage, sync, history, lifecycle, encryption, policy gates); apps own the schema. The reference shape lives in the showcase and recipe as copy-paste material — `import { type UserShape } from '@noy-db/hub'` is intentionally NOT a thing.

  ### New API on every Vault

  ```ts
  // Write-self — own keyringId only (own-only write rule, structural)
  vault.user.me<T>(): Promise<UserEnvelope<T> | null>
  vault.user.updateMe<T>(patch: DeepPartial<T>, presented?): Promise<UserEnvelope<T>>
  vault.user.setMe<T>(payload: T, presented?): Promise<UserEnvelope<T>>

  // Read-anyone — gated by view-team-profiles (default minTier: 2)
  vault.user.get<T>(keyringId, presented?): Promise<UserEnvelope<T> | null>
  vault.user.list<T>(presented?): Promise<UserEnvelope<T>[]>

  // Reactive — fires on local writes
  vault.user.subscribe<T>(keyringId, cb): Unsubscribe
  vault.user.live<T>(keyringId): LiveUserEnvelope<T>
  ```

  ### New built-in policy gates

  | Gate                 | PERSONAL_POLICY  | STRICT_POLICY                                    |
  | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | `edit-own-profile`   | `{ minTier: 3 }` | `{ minTier: 2, factors: [{ anyOf: ['totp'] }] }` |
  | `view-team-profiles` | `{ minTier: 2 }` | `{ minTier: 2 }`                                 |

  `view-team-profiles.enabled: false` is the privacy-strict opt-out — `vault.user.list()` silently returns `[me]` only; `vault.user.get(other)` throws `PolicyDeniedError`. The own-only write rule is structural — no policy can relax it.

  ### New on `db.grant()`

  `initialProfile?: T` — admin pre-fill for the new principal's first envelope, seeded under the caller's `_users` DEK. Once the user activates, the own-only rule prevents further admin edits. Bootstrap-only.

  ### New on `team/keyring.ts`

  `listUsersWithEnvelopes<T>(adapter, vault, dek)` — joined enumeration of keyrings + their envelopes. Convenience for admin UIs.

  ### Lifecycle binding

  - `createOwnerKeyring()` eager-provisions the `_users` DEK at vault creation; every subsequent `grant()` propagates it via the existing system-collection branch.
  - `revoke()` cascade-deletes the principal's envelope alongside the keyring.
  - DEK rotation re-encrypts every `_users/*` envelope under the fresh DEK (free, since `_users` is in the affected collections set).

  ## Client-API unblockers for niwat

  ### `db.enrollWebAuthn(vault, ceremony, presented?)`

  Native WebAuthn enrollment using the **real** internal keyring. Unblocks `vLannaAi/niwat#31`. The ceremony callback receives the live `UnlockedKeyring` so the `wrapped_kek` references the live KEK (not a synthetic app-layer payload that fails at unlock time). Hub does not import `@noy-db/on-webauthn` (would invert dep graph); consumers wire the on-webauthn `enrollWebAuthn` function in via the ceremony callback.

  ### `db.listWebAuthnSlots(vault)`

  Filter the slot list to webauthn-method slots only. Returns `id`, `enrolledAt`, `credentialId` — useful for "you have N WebAuthn credentials" UI surfaces and `allowCredentials` lookups.

  ### `db.lockVault(vault)`

  Soft-lock that scrubs `keyringCache`, `vaultCache`, `activeTier`, `syncEngines`, `policyEnforcers` for the vault — but preserves `quickUnlock` (PIN resume after lock-screen UX) and `policyCache` (on-disk policy survives lock). Idempotent; the `Noydb` instance remains usable. Unblocks `vLannaAi/niwat#33`.

  ## Forward-compat (documented, not exported in v1)

  The `UserProfileProvider` interface is documented in `docs/subsystems/user-envelope.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-user-envelope-design.md`. Implementation lands post-1.0 alongside managed-passphrase mode (#14).

  ## Documentation

  - `docs/subsystems/user-envelope.md` — full subsystem reference
  - `docs/recipes/user-preferences.md` — reference shape pattern
  - `showcases/src/70-user-envelope.showcase.test.ts` — Hub API end-to-end (vitest)
  - `showcases/src/recipe-user-preferences.recipe.test.ts` — runnable recipe (vitest)
  - `features.yaml` — registered (validates clean: 26 features, 6 recipes)

  ## Tests

  - 41 new user-envelope tests (storage, API, lifecycle, gates, team integration)
  - 6 new enroll-webauthn tests
  - 7 new lock-vault tests
  - Hub suite: 1297/1297 green. Full repo: 2338/2338 green.

  ## Breaking changes

  None. All additions are additive; default behavior of pre-existing vaults is unchanged. Pre-existing vaults have a documented one-time DEK-rotate workflow when adopting `vault.user.*` for multi-principal reads (see "Edge cases & limits" in `docs/subsystems/user-envelope.md`).
